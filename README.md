      So for the second project, I thought to myself, because I love going on reddit, why not make a clone of it?

We had to build a website while also implementing the server side. We have to have multiple models that we would use to expand the features of the website. There is also a user model that allows us to log in and out of the website. Within my website you are able to edit your profile and change our password when you need to.

There are multiple challenges regarding this project as it was one regarding the server side. The validations would have been a really hard challenge if it weren't for Mike helping us. Other problems are regarding the EJS syntax that we had to use because of the different things that you are able to use instead of what you use in javascript.

The features that I am going to add in the future is that I want users to be able to put up videos in the website rather than just images. I would also like to implement subreddits just like the reddit website. It would be nice to see this website expand and try to be a copy of reddit (hopefully not being sued for making it similar to reddit).
